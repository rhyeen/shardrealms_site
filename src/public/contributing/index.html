    <h1>How to contribute to Shardrealms</h1>
    <p>Thanks for your interest in contributing to Shardrealms.  It’s been a lot of effort on our end to get the project to where it is today, but we still have a long ways left to go!  That’s why we really appreciate your willingness to help.</p>
    <p>We want this to be an enjoyable project for you.  So if you ever find yourself unsure of where to start or what to do, feel free to reach out to our admins at <strong>shardrealms@gmail.com</strong>.  That being said, we’re all <strong>extremely</strong> busy with our daytime jobs, families, and the development of Shardrealms.  So if we don’t respond in some time, please be patient.</p>
    <p>We want to be sure to provide you with the resources you need to contribute without our guidance as much as possible.  We will be using some tools and documents to lead you to approved and confident contributions.  Here are a few things to help get you started.</p>
    <h3>Slack team</h3>
    <p>We will be using <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> to communicate all things regarding Shardrealms.  The quickest and easiest way to get answers to all your questions and to join together with fellow contributors is to post on the Slack channels.  To start, <a href="https://join.slack.com/shardrealms/shared_invite/MTg5OTg2NjE3MTkwLTE0OTYwMTk4MTItN2M4Njc0OWEyYg" target="_blank">join the Slack team</a>.</p>
    <h3>Shardrealms App</h3>
    <p>The Shardrealms Creation App is a powerful open-source tool for a game master to keep track of his campaign story.  It will eventually be available to the public, but for now, it is only accessible by running the application on your computer.  Basic web software development skills are a requirement to contribute to the application.</p>
    <p>If you want to contribute to the development of the Shardrealms App, you can find the <a href="https://github.com/rhyeen/sr_creation" target="_blank">Shardrealms App Base Repository on Github</a> with instructions on how to get started on contributions.</p>
    <h3>Shardrealms Universe</h3>
    <p>The Shardrealms Universe is a high-fantasy story setting for tabletop RPGs.  It is entirely free, community-driven, and compatible with the Shardrealms System and App.  Contributors can be just about anyone: story writers, proofreaders, testers, artists, designers, etc.</p>
